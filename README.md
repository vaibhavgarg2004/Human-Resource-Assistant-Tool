## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Tool-Based Functions** : Each HR task (onboarding, leave requests, meeting scheduling, ticket generation, emailing) is exposed as an MCP tool.

2. **Conversational & Tool Use** : Claude Desktop's agent can select and combine these tools via conversation, automating multi-step HR flows.  

3. **Data Handling** : Uses Pydantic schemas for input validation, dummy data for testing, and secure environment-driven email config.

4. **Demo & Testing** : Demo datasets for employees, managers, leave records, tickets, and meetings are auto-seeded for a smooth trial

---

## 💡 Example Workflow: New Employee Onboarding
1. **Add Employee** : Fills new record, verifies unique ID and manager exists.

2. **Welcome Email** : Email sent with login and next steps.

3. **Manager Notification** : Manager is alerted automatically.

4. **Raise Tickets**: Tickets created for IT hardware and welcome kit.

5. **Schedule Meeting**: Manager and employee are booked for an intro call.
